title: Provisioning events
description: Understanding the events timeline
---

The **Events** tab on the environment detail page shows a timeline of everything that happens during provisioning.

## Event types

Each event represents a step in the provisioning process:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Namespace creation** | Isolated runtime namespace is created |
| **Storage setup** | Persistent storage is provisioned |
| **Runtime deployment** | The sandbox runtime is deployed and configured |
| **TLS certificate** | HTTPS certificate is issued |
| **DNS record** | Domain record is created when preview routing needs it |
| **Configuration** | Repository, secret, preset, and port settings are applied |

## Event details

Each event in the timeline shows:

- **Timestamp** — when the event occurred
- **Status** — completed (green), failed (red), or in progress (yellow)
- **Message** — description of what happened
- **Change badges** — what infrastructure was affected:
  - `+` (green) — created
  - `~` (yellow) — updated
  - `-` (red) — removed
  - `→` (blue) — read

## Using events for troubleshooting

When provisioning fails:

1. Open the **Events** tab
2. Find the event with a red (failed) status
3. Expand it to see the error details
4. Common patterns:
   - **Timeout** — a component took too long to become ready
   - **Conflict** — a component already exists (from a previous attempt)
   - **Permission** — insufficient permissions for the operation

Share the event details when contacting support for faster resolution.
